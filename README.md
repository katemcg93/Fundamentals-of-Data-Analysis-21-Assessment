## Introduction
This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks. 

The first, pyplot.ipynb, provides a comprehensive overview of the matplotlib pypplot package. 

The first section of the notebook describes the overall purpose of the package, including its links to MATLAB and the stateless/object oriented approaches to plot creation. 

The second section provides an overview and a demonstration of three interesting plot types available in matplotlib. These are the stacked histogram, correlation matrix and stacked area plot. For each case, a real dataset is used to simulate a use case for the plot. For the first two plots, the Framingham Heart Study, a longitudal study of cardiovascular disease risk indicators, is used. Weekly Covid-19 case figures from Eurostat provide the basis for the third plot. 

The second notebook, cao.ipynb, comprises an in-depth analysis of CAO points data over the last three years. The first section of the notebook deals with obtaining the points data, from the CAO website, creating backups and converting the data, in its various formats, to Pandas dataframes for further analysis. The second section discusses how the analysis was conducted and key findings.
