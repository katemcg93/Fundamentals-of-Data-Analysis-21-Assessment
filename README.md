## Introduction
This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks. 

#### Matplotlib Pyplot

The first, pyplot.ipynb, provides a comprehensive overview of the matplotlib pypplot package. 

The first section of the notebook describes the overall purpose of the package and its applications as a data visualisation tool. The key concepts underpinning the Matplotlib functionality are explained, such as the object hierarchy and the stateless vs the object-oriented approaches to creating figures.

The second section provides an overview and a demonstration of three interesting plot types available in matplotlib. These are the stacked histogram, correlation matrix and stacked area plot. For each case, a real dataset is used to simulate a use case for the plot. For the first two plots, the Framingham Heart Study, a longitudal study of cardiovascular disease risk indicators, is used. Weekly Covid-19 case figures from Eurostat provide the basis for the third plot. 

#### CAO Data 2019 - 2021

The second notebook, cao.ipynb, comprises an in-depth analysis of CAO points data over the last three years. The first section of the notebook deals with obtaining the points data,from the CAO website, creating backups and converting the datasets, in their various formats, to Pandas dataframes for further analysis. The second part discusses the analysis conducted on the CAO dataset, which is divided into the following overall research areas:
- Descriptive Statistics : mean, median, mode and standard deviation figures for Level 8 courses over the past three years
- Overall distribution of points data 2019 - 2021
- Most popular areas of study and how the distributions for these have changed between 2019 and 2021
- Average points required for Ireland's main universities and Institutes of Technology
- Trends in highest and lowest point courses from 2019 - 2021
