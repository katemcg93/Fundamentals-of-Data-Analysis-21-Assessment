    "# Section One : Overview of Data Visualisation and Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Data Visualization?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data visualization is the process of taking raw data and converting it to a format easily absorbed by the human brain, such as an image, chart or plot. The main goal of visualization is to help identify trends and patterns in data, as well as outliers. These insights can then be used to aid the decision-making process [1]. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the era of Big Data, the ability to make sense of the trillions of rows of raw data generated daily is essential; visualisation is integral to this process. [2]. Data visualisation is useful for cleaning data and understanding its structure, detecting outliers or unexpected patterns, evaluating the validity of model output and presenting results. Images often reveal features of the dataset that are overlooked by statistics and models, such as unusual distributions of data, clusters, outliers and missing values [3]. \n",
    "\n",
    "As well as improving our understanding of a dataset, visualisation can help us communicate our findings more effectively. Good visualisation uses data to tell a story, filtering out the noise and keeping only the actionable insights. Easily understandable data benefits almost every industry: all areas of STEM, government, marketing, finance, sports, consumer goods and so on. Effective visualisation can help stakeholders from any field understand their data and use it to make informed decisions [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Visualisation and Python\n",
    "\n",
    "As the relevance of data visualization has grown, so has the variety of Business Intelligence (BI) tools created for this purpose. These range from proprietary software packages like Microsoft's Power BI and Tableau, to libraries built on programming languages like Python. As well as being open-source and accessible to beginners, Python is highly flexible and can be adapted to a wide range of use cases. Therefore, several graphing libraries have been built on Python with an extensive range of features.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most widely used Python graphing libraries is Matplotlib. Matplotlib allows users to create two-dimensional plots of data from a range of sources, including lists, numpy arrays and pandas dataframes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib uses an object-oriented approach to plotting, meaning that plots can be built step by step by adding additional elements to them. This gives users a high level of control over the plots they create and lends itself to a high degree of customizabilty. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main objects associated with a matplotlib plot:\n",
    "1. Figure: The entire plot space, which can hold one or more axes\n",
    "2. Axis : Axes are the individual plots that are rendered within the figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in Matplotlib, the axes refer to the plot in its entirety, including the x and y axes, as illustrated below. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Matplotlib Plot Components](https://files.realpython.com/media/fig_map.bc8c7cabd823.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all elements of a matplotlib plot, up to and including ticks and labels, has its own callable object and can therefore be customized.\n",
    "\n",
    "## MATLAB and Pyplot\n",
    "\n",
    "MATLAB is a high-performance language designed for mathematical computing. Some common use-cases for MATLAB include:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Algorithm development\n",
    " - Modelling, simulating and prototyping\n",
    " - Data Analysis, exploration and visualization\n",
    " \n",
    "MATLAB is well-established as a high-quality environment for computation and data analysis, particularly when working with arrays or matrices. However, in recent years Python has become increasingly popular for these purposes, and its computational power for mathematical tasks is on a par with MATLAB. Additionally, Python is open-source while MATLAB is proprietary and expensive, meaning a programme developed in MATLAB will reach a much smaller audience than one developed in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, MATLAB programmers are converting to Python, and the pyplot module is designed to ease this transition by emulating MATLAB's global style. In MATLAB, the concept of importing is less prevalent than in Python, and most functions are available to the user at the top level, without the need for additional import commands. The main purpose of the pyplot module is to bring functions and classes from MATLAB and python directly into the namespace, which means that users can call them without additional import statements, like they can in MATLAB.This  purpose was initially served by a similar module named pylab, which "
